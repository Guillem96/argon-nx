## What Argon is?

Argon is a noble gas.
"Argon" comes from Greek "Argon", neuter of "argos" meaning *lazy* , *idle* or *inactive*.
Argon recieved this name because its chemical inactivity.

Argon NX is an immutable payload which is injected to your Nintendo Switch via Fusee Gelee exploit.

## Purpose 

The purpose of Argon NX is to stay immutable, so you can always inject it, without caring about other payloads getting updated (Always use ArgonNX for TegraSmash, TegraGUI, TrinkedM0...).

## How can it be?

When Argon NX is injected it automatically launches the `payload.bin` loacted at `argon` directory on your SD Card root. 

If `payload.bin` is not present or VOOLUME DOWN button is pressed on payload injection, Argon NX will list all payloads located at `argon/payloads`, and you will be able to select one of theme to launch it.

## Features

- Autolaunch/autochainload the payload named `payload.bin` inside `argon` directory in your sd card root
- If `argon/payload.bin` is not found or `VOLUME_DOWN_BUTTON` is held during ArgonNX injection, ArgonNX lists all the payloads located at `argon/payloads`, so you can select one of them to launch it.
- Customize payloads' logos. **Logos must be smaller or equal than 200x200**. Example:
```
argon
  ├───logos
  │     default.bmp       # Default logo (logo for all payloads)
  │     fusee-primary.bmp # Logo for fusee-primary.bin payload
  │
  └───payloads
        fusee-primary.bin
        ReiNX.bin         # Will be rendered using default logo
```
- Custom background add a custom background by simply adding `background.bmp` file inside `argon` directory. **Background must be smaller or equal than 1280x720**.
- Custom title add a custom title by simply adding `title.bmp` file inside `argon` directory. **Not an specific size for title**.

## About BMP format

The only format supported is **BMP 32 bit ARGB color**.
Color used for transparency is **#1D1919**.

## Improve performance

ArgonNX uses **minerva dram training** to improve performance.
Use of minerva is optional but recommended, to use minerva just place the compiled `minerva.bso` inside `argon/sys`. The directory `argon/sys` with minerva, is included in `sd-files.zip` in the release section.

## Compatibility

Works with all cfw payloads. 
Not tested with TeamXecuter SXOS payload, but it should work too.

## Roadmap

1. Touch input
2. Kind of config file
3. Change font
